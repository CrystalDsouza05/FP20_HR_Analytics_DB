# HR Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì FP20 Analytics Challenge 30  

Dashboard Link Coming Soon...

This repository contains my submission for **FP20 Analytics Challenge 30 ‚Äì HR Analytics Challenge**, where the goal was to design an interactive HR dashboard to analyze workforce insights, performance, and employee metrics.  

The dashboard is built in **Power BI** and makes extensive use of **Field Parameters**, allowing users to dynamically switch between KPIs across different visuals without creating multiple charts.
